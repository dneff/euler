Ah, hubris...

    Progress on a self-imposed challenge:

    Work through the 366 problems on Project Euler by the end of 2012.

        1. Work must be done in python
        2. No custom libraries
        3. No googling formulas until you've solved the problem
        4. Solution must execute in under 300 seconds
        
I missed the deadline, but I'm still going strong. As for the other rules, 3 can be brutal. Quite a few euler problems have a optimally elegant solution that's orders of magnitude more efficient than the rest.

One lesson I didn't expect is how consistently I overestimate the time and complexity of solving a puzzle.

This process continues to be very enjoyable.
